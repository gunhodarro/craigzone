# CRAIGZONE

As a user i want to be able to search for items on Craigslist in a simpler form so that I can narrow my searches and have a more user friendly experience and it is more visually appealing. I would also like to see a current map view of my location so that i could see near by locations to see where an item may be located. In addition i want to be able to be emailed what i am searching for.

The basic functions of the Craigzone app is we use a scraper in order to get information from Craigslist narrowed down, to category, keyword, price range, and location. You can also get current location to show where you are at, which is useful if you find an item in a location you are not familar with or to see if its close by. After you decided on these inputs, you will enter an email and then be able to recive emails on the item or product you are searching for.
